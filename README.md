This program creates a txt file that report the top streamed music artists during certain week in alphabetical order. The data used in the program is the spotify top chart csv file found in https://spotifycharts.com/. The data is imported to the program with BufferedReader in java and ouputed via BufferedWriter. The data is sorted with a linked list structure. A node class was created for the artist alongside with a sorted linkedlist class called 'TopStreamingArtists.' Data is inserted to the linkedlist as an array that contains the name of the artist and is formatted with regex, also any null value are removed by parsing the data using a list to avoid error of nullpointerexception. Data of the linked list is sorted by comparing the String with the case being ignored, if the String is larger than the previous String, then the String is placed at the previous node.
